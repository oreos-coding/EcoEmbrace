  <h1>MEDITATION-GUIDE</h1>
<article>
   In this moment right now,<br> I want you to find a space <br>to externally and internally
    disconnect from the outside noise.<br>
    May we take this opportunity to let go of the day,
      </br>
    let go of the idea
    </br>
    if it was good or bad and
    </br>
    simply fall into the silence and peace within your heart.
    </br>
    So let's find a comfortable seated position.
    </br>
    </br>
    Take a deep breath in
    and exhale out.
    </br>
    Rest your hands comfortably on your lap.
    </br>
    Close your eyes.
    </br>
    Notice how you're feeling right now in this moment.
    </br>
    Inhale and exhale.
    </br>
    Take this opportunity to let go of the heaviness, the body, the mind.
    </br>
    Allow any tension to release out of your face, relax your forehead.
    </br>
    Allow your eyes to be heavy, the jaw to be relaxed.
    Inhale and exhale.
    </br>
    There is no more need to hold on to anything anymore.
    </br>
    Give yourself the permission to truly surrender to rest,
    to peace
    </br>
    and to the calm and loving energy within you.
    </br>
    Inhale
    </br>
    and exhale.
    </br>
    Let go of your shoulders.
    </br>
    Let them fall away, downward, away from your ears.
    </br>
    Releasing any heaviness, weight and tension that the world may have brought upon you today.
    </br>
    Let it go.
    </br>
    Allow your arms to be heavy,
    </br>
    soft and relaxed.
    </br>
    Feel your heart gently beating with each inhale and exhale,
    </br>
    reminding you of the powerful energy that exists within,
    </br>
    reminding you of this beautiful life that you have,
    </br>
    that you get to experience through all the positive and challenging moments each serving a purpose,
    </br>
    to find gratitude,
    </br>
    to find strength,
    </br>
    peace and acceptance of this magical existence on this earth.
    </br>
    Breathe in.
    Breathe out.
    </br>
    With every breath that you take right now
    </br>
    open your heart to gratitude,
    </br>
    to love,
    to forgiveness
    </br>
    and to this presence within you.
    </br>
    You are strong, you are powerful, you are beautiful.
    </br>
    You are loved and you are love.
    </br>
    Let this idea sit with you as you slowly give yourself permission to relax,
    </br>
    to let go of the day, the worries, the uncertainty,
    </br>
    digging deeper within yourself to find the true essence of what and who you are,
    </br>
    your
    loving
    conscious awareness.
    </br>
    Inhale
    and exhale.
    </br>
    Notice your breath, notice what comes to you as you begin to let go.
    </br>
    Notice any images, colors, shapes or memories that may arise.
    </br>
    Without any judgment
    </br>
    simply stay aware
    </br>
    as you give yourself permission to relax deeper and deeper.
    </br>
    Within this present internal awareness
    </br>
    begin to visualize yourself
    </br>
    melting deeper and deeper into your relaxed state of being,
    your body
    </br>
    getting heavier
    </br>
    as you open your heart to the loving energy that you're cultivating from within.
    </br>
    Breathe,
    </br>
    rest
    and let go,
    </br>
    just let go.
    </br>
    Listening to the sound of the rain, let yourself be filled with ease, serenity
    </br>
    bliss and deep loving relaxation.
    </br>
    Breathe in,
    breathe out
    </br>
    and let go.
    Breathe in, breathe out.
